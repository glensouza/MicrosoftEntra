![Microsoft Entra](./me.png)

Microsoft has announced that it will be renaming Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to **Microsoft Entra ID** as part of its commitment to simplify secure access experiences for everyone.

The renaming will take effect on October 1, 2023, and all existing deployments, configurations, and integrations will continue to function as they do today without any action from users.

## What is Identity and Access Management (IAM)

In the context of cloud computing, IAM assumes an even more critical role.

As resources are accessed remotely, often beyond the traditional network boundaries, IAM ensures that only authenticated and authorized users can access these resources.

This enhances security and facilitates regulatory compliance and efficient resource management.

## What is Microsoft Entra

Microsoft Entra ID is Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service. It helps organizations securely manage and provide access to their apps, data, and even hardware resources. Here's a brief overview:

- **Identity Management**: Microsoft Entra ID stores information about users (like usernames and passwords) and determines what those users can access and do.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Allows users to sign in once and then access multiple apps without needing to log in again for each one.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Microsoft Entra ID can add an extra layer of security by requiring two or more methods of verification before granting access. For example, besides a password, a user might also need to enter a code sent to their phone.
- **Conditional Access**: It can determine access based on various conditions, such as the user's location, device, or risk level.
- **Integration with Various Apps**: Microsoft Entra ID works not only with Microsoft applications but also with a wide range of external apps, allowing for centralized identity management regardless of the application platform.
Device Management: Microsoft Entra ID can manage devices, ensuring they meet specific security standards before accessing certain resources.

## Azure AD to Microsoft Entra ID

Microsoft Entra is the new name for Azure Active Directory. The name change will be reflected across the service, including the Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, and APIs.

Personally, I always thought the naming didn't reflect its purpose. Azure AD was not just an on-premise Active Directory version in the cloud. It's a cloud-based identity and access management service.

So now we can think of Microsoft Entra as that **entry** way into all of our services like single sign-on and other centralized security services.

### Why is the name being changed

As part of our ongoing commitment to simplify secure access experiences for everyone, the renaming of Azure AD to Microsoft Entra ID is designed to make it easier to use and navigate the unified and expanded Microsoft Entra product family.

The Microsoft Entra ID name more accurately represents the multicloud and multiplatform functionality of the product, alleviates confusion with the on-premises identity solution (Active Directory), and creates a path to deliver a simpler way to protect every identity and secure every access point as we expand the Microsoft Entra identity and network access portfolio.

### Logo/icon change

Azure AD product icons are replaced with the Microsoft Entra ID product icon.

## What names aren't changing

The following table lists terminology that is not impacted by the Azure AD rename. Names aren't changing for Active Directory, developer tools, Azure AD B2C, nor deprecated or retired functionality, features, or services.

### Active Directory

Windows Server Active Directory, commonly known as Active Directory, and related features and services associated with Active Directory aren't branded with Microsoft Entra.

- Windows Server Active Directory
- Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Active Directory
- Any Active Directory feature(s)

### Authentication library

- **Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL)** is deprecated. While existing apps that use ADAL continue to work, Microsoft will no longer release security fixes on ADAL. Migrate applications to the _Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)_ to avoid putting your app's security at risk.
- [**Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-overview) - Provides security tokens from the Microsoft identity platform to authenticate users and access secured web APIs to provide secure access to Microsoft Graph, other Microsoft APIs, third-party web APIs, or your own web API.

### Azure AD B2C

[Azure Active Directory B2C](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c) isn't being renamed. We're continuing to invest in security, availability, and reliability in Azure AD B2C and our next-generation solution for external identities, [Microsoft Entra External ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities).

### Graph

- **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Graph** is deprecated. Going forward, further investment in Azure AD Graph won't be made, and Azure AD Graph APIs have no SLA or maintenance commitment beyond security-related fixes. Investments in new features and functionalities will only be made in _Microsoft Graph_.
- [Microsoft Graph](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph) - Grants programmatic access to organization, user, and application data stored in Microsoft Entra ID.

### PowerShell

- **Azure AD PowerShell** for Graph is planned for deprecation on March 30, 2024. For more info on the deprecation plans, see the deprecation update. We encourage you to migrate to _Microsoft Graph PowerShell_, which is the recommended module for interacting with Azure AD.
- [Microsoft Graph PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/overview) - Acts as an API wrapper for the Microsoft Graph APIs and helps administer every Microsoft Entra ID feature that has an API in Microsoft Graph.

### Accounts

- Microsoft account
- Work or school account

For end user sign-ins and account experiences, follow guidance for work and school accounts in [Sign in with Microsoft branding guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-add-branding-in-apps).

### Microsoft identity platform

The Microsoft identity platform encompasses all our identity and access developer assets. It continues to provide the resources to help you build applications that your users and customers can sign in to using their Microsoft identities or social accounts.

### Sync

DirSync and Azure AD Sync aren't supported and no longer work. If you're still using DirSync or Azure AD Sync, you must upgrade to [Microsoft Entra Connect](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/connect/how-to-dirsync-upgrade-get-started) to resume your sync process.
